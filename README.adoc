mvn clean install from the top will create the Events API jar (containing domain object and bus client code), a WAR that listens to the bus and stores events it receives, and some test servlets that let you query the events (if being persisted in JDBC) and add events.

To run, unzip the distro zip you find in hawkular-events-distro/target/ and run wildfly*/bin/standalone.sh. This starts a simple events server for testing.

You can send event messages to the bus via curl over the bus' REST interface:

curl -d "body={"subsystem":{"name":"mysub"},"message":"mymsg2","details":{"key2":"value2","key1":"value1"}}" http://localhost:8080/hawkular-bus/message/EventsQueue?type=queue

Or you can use the test servlet to also add events (notice the parameters):

http://localhost:8080/hawkular-events/EventsInsertServlet?message=MyMessage&subsystem=MYSUBSYS&detail1=value1&moreDetails=wotgorilla

You can look at the events (if the backend storage is used) via http://localhost:8080/hawkular-events/EventsQueryServlet
