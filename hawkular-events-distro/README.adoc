Build this and run standalone.sh to get an events server running.

You send event messages over the bus that are then stored. You can send event messages via curl over the bus' REST interface:

curl -d "body={"subsystem":{"name":"mysub"},"message":"mymsg2","details":{"key2":"value2","key1":"value1"}}" http://localhost:8080/hawkular-bus/message/EventsQueue?type=queue

You can look at the events (if the backend storage is used) via http://localhost:8080/hawkular-events/EventsQueryServlet
